      <h1>WIP  // SUBJECT TO CHANGE // VIOLENCE ENSUES // CULTURAL INDIGNITY</h1>

      <p>I don't do a lot of blogging.</p>

      <p>Back up. I blog a lot, but it's to people. I like people, and that's
      really what this post is going to be about.</p>

      <p>But I don't really write big blocks of text for general consumption
      these days unless they're technical explanations of why something can or
      can't be done along with a couple of jokes and a nice metaphor about a
      rat named Stephen.</p>

      <p>And there may be a reason for that.</p>

      <p>But collaboration is key. A few weeks or months ago I saw a link in IRC
      or on a blog post or something pointing me to this crazy new website:
      https://chat.meatspac.es. It's this thing where you click on it and
      suddenly there are a bunch of short, looping animated gifs of people
      doing people things alongside lines of text which you can pretty easily
      presume they've written.</p>

      <p>And I immediately said 'huh' and closed the tab and didn't think about
      it again. I don't even know that I filed it away under anything under
      than 'seen it,' because I really have no idea how my mental filing
      system works. I think it's probably filled with snakes. Snakes and
      ladders. Both good things to watch out for.</p>

      <p>The point is, it wasn't for me right then. I'm saying this now because
      this is really what I'm talking about.</p>

      <p>The right people have to hit each other the right way to click. And it
      doesn't always work.</p>

      <p>Tonight I read this blog by my new friend @ednapiranha, who created
      chat.meatspace.es. We were already talking about cooperation and
      interaction, but it's a good blog post and you should read it because it
      sets up everything I'm about to say.</p>

      <p><a href="http://ednapiranha.com/2013/meatspace-chat-social-constraints">http://ednapiranha.com/2013/meatspace-chat-social-constraints</a></p>

      <p>And since I'm about as good at linear narration as I am at not beginning
      my sentences with 'and,' this takes us to Friday night.</p>

      <p>The night before I'd been up way too long being way too depressed and
      way too emotional about way too many things in a way that was way too
      stiff and busted. Friday I woke up and decided I was going out to my
      favorite bar regardless of the terrible traffic and regardless of the
      setting sun. And I did it.</p>

      <p>I had two drinks, a shot, and left. Which isn't something I do. I like
      cocktails. I know some great bartenders, and I usually close the bar
      regardless of when I get there.</p>

      <p>I go home and fuck around on the internet for a couple of hours. Then my
      friend hep posts this link to her facebook:</p>

      <p><a href="http://fomolabs.tumblr.com/post/78183114257/how-meatspace-changed-my-life">http://fomolabs.tumblr.com/post/78183114257/how-meatspace-changed-my-life</a></p>

      <p>And I skimmed it. I didn't read it at first because I didn't have to. It
      pushed a lot of buttons all at once and I didn't really know why.</p>

      <p>And that's when I went to chat.meatspace.es for the second time,
      immediately recognized it as something I'd seen before, but also
      immediately discarded that information because it wasn't relevant
      anymore.</p>

      <p>First impressions happen every day.</p>

      <p>What's really remarkable about human interaction is how good we are at
      completely dismissing huge chunks of information all at once. Every
      single stone of our foundation can be ripped out, all at once or just a
      few, at any given time and replaced with any other thing based on whim.
      We call it epiphany, or inspiration, or learning.</p>

      <p>The point is, we're flexible. So, again, First impressions happen every
      day.</p>

      <p>When we meet people and then meet them again, later, and realize that
      our impressions are different from the expectations we established when
      we met them the first time, sometimes we struggle with it. Sometimes
      it's no big deal. Sometimes we say things like, "I don't think I really
      knew you then," or, "I guess we've both changed."</p>

      <p>Of course you didn't know them then, and of course you've both changed,
      because everything's in motion all the time. It's our expectation that
      it's not going to change that makes us think it's standing still. And we
      do this because we have to, because walking all over a bunch of
      electrons spinning around and trying not to fall through them is the
      removal of every layer of abstraction necessary for us to get through
      the day.</p>

      <p>And this isn't just about nuclear forces, remember: It's about people.</p>

      <p>We need these layers of abstraction in order to function in society. But
      the apparatus of social abstraction and expectation can be peeled back
      and even crated and stored, disused, when that epiphany, that learning,
      takes place. It's a scaffold, a crutch, a crust that we don't need at
      this critical moment of interaction because we've reached the most
      important idiom of this post: the meat.</p>

      <p>Let's talk about cryptography.</p>

      <p>The first thing about a secret is that it's shared. This is arguable. I
      guess you could think a secret isn't a secret anymore once it's shared,
      but the idea, the concept that I think of when I hear 'secret' is
      "something others know that I don't' or 'something I know that they
      don't."</p>

      <p>But if it's something you know, something you have inside of you, then
      that's just something inside of you, right? It's not a secret until you
      tell someone. But when you tell yourself, 'that's my secret,' ha ha,
      guess what, you just told yourself. Which, if you think about it, you do
      a lot. You probably just did it again. Now I'm doing it.</p>

      <p>So the secret is all about the sharing. It's cooperation. It's
      communication. It's something that has intrinsic and discrete meaning
      for both parties. The meaning might actually be different, but the
      object itself is the same, the token is shared and we're both operating
      off of the same general principle, and when I say potato you know I mean
      potato. The semantic definition of the item results in a shared look
      across the room and a subtle change in expression when someone mentions
      tequila and you and your best friend simultaneously remember the night
      you passed out on each other in the laundry room in a pile of vomit.</p>

      <p>There's more information in a secret message than just the message.
      There's a sender, a receiver, and a payload. The payload is what
      everyone thinks is the meaty stuff, but the sender and receiver are
      extremely important, too.</p>

      <p>The secret isn't the secret, the secret is the sharing.</p>

      <p>So the secret is actually the combination of the sender, the receiver,
      the payload, and the semantic meanings associated with that cooperative
      system.</p>

      <p>In the tequila metaphor, the sender and receiver are interchangeable and
      not actually sending or receiving much to or from each other: they're
      being triggered by a payload, offered by a third party, which only has
      semantic meaning to the 'sender' and 'receiver.'</p>

      <p>And that's why human relationships are so tricky. Because you and the
      person you're dating aren't two people, you're at minimum three: you,
      them, and the combination of you and them. And then there's you and them
      vs. you, and you and them vs. them, and you vs. you, and them vs. them,
      and them vs. you and them, and turtles. Turtles all the way down.</p>

      <p>These are discrete social forces, discrete semantic meanings, discrete
      senders and receivers of various payloads. The parts are practically
      interchangeable in this example, what's important is the interaction.
      The cooperative system.</p>

      <p>If I send an email message to someone, in that email message, the
      headers reveal that I'm the one who sent it and they're the one to whom
      it was sent. And on their end, when it's received, it'll say that
      they're the one who received it and I'm the one who sent it.</p>

      <p>I need to send a message to someone, but I can't reveal who they are or
      where they are. How do I send it?</p>

      <p>Easy. Send it to everyone. Numbers stations, spam email, you name it, if
      you see it then it probably has some manner of semantic meaning to
      someone else that it doesn't have to you. This is how advertising works,
      and it's more complicated than it seems on the surface: the effect an
      advertisement had on the person sitting next to you can change the way
      the advertisement affected you. Turtles again, all the way down. It
      propagates.</p>

      <p>Abstraction again. We need it. This is precisely why we need it. Because
      if we were aware of all the stones and ripples and people around us --
      and that the people around us aren't anything like the people we're
      forced to decide they are -- then we'd go crazy. And a lot of people do
      from time to time. Sometimes it leads to things like being depressed on
      a Friday night and ending up staring at a bunch of faces you don't
      recognize with a couple that you do and a bunch of lines of text next to
      their cycling, short animated images which you presume they've probably
      written.</p>

      <p>So there I am, and these people are having a conversation, and I don't
      even know what it's about. But I say hello, and pretty soon we're
      sharing jokes and I'm meeting people and we're sharing music and talking
      about aspirations and ideas we have and projects we're working on and
      sharing stories and encouraging, helping one another with various
      things, offering advice and recommendation.</p>

      <p>And by pretty soon I mean more or less instantaneously. Because that's
      the secret of cooperative systems: the right people need to hit the
      right people at the right time or it doesn't click. But it could at any
      time, because first impressions happen every day. We're flexible, and
      epiphany is always around the corner.</p>

      <p>And my horrible, horrible weekend turned into one of the most positive
      early mornings that I can recall, with strangers on the internet who
      aren't strangers at all. People came and went and were accepted freely
      and easily on each individual occasion. Information aggregated but
      didn't affect expectation. The ephemeral nature of the method of
      communication lent every individual moment of interaction its own
      semantic meaning, and they don't necessarily need to be assembled
      together or in order to have impact.</p>

      <p>Expectation dynamics are ruinous.</p>

      <p>A long time ago it occurred to me that people should marry each other as
      soon as they feel that 'click,' because then everything that comes along
      becomes an opportunity instead of an obligation. "The fence is broken."
      "Well, I'm a carpenter." "Oh, hey, how handy." instead of, "The fence is
      broken. Go fix it, you're a carpenter."</p>

      <p>It's a huge difference. Huge. Insurmountable, sometimes. And aggregated
      expectations create situations which we can't unravel ourselves from. We
      become aware of the turtles, and we keep adding to the stack.

      <p>Let's talk about cryptography.</p>

      <p>A quick and dirty explanation of public key cryptography is that you
      have two giant numbers which are related to each other in some
      repeatable fashion and you share one of them with everyone and keep the
      other one private.</p>

      <p>So I know my private number, and you know your private number, and we
      both share our public numbers with each other. What this means is that,
      because I know both my public AND my private number, and they're
      mathematically linked, and both of your numbers are also mathematically
      linked, when you send me a message which is linked between your PRIVATE
      key and my PUBLIC key, I'm able to read it with my PRIVATE key linked to
      your PUBLIC key.</p>

      <p>Which is a concept I've already expounded upon repeatedly in this post:
      Sender, receiver, payload, semantic meaning. They're all in the system.</p>

      <p>Public key cryptography is one of the most widely used encryption
      methods used, period, and you use it every day. Checking your email,
      performing credit card transactions, calling your buddy in Malaysia. You
      can more or less bet absolutely that somewhere in there there's some
      public key cryptography taking place.</p>

      <p>And it happens every day in the meat world, too. I know I'm Marc, you
      know you're you. But what Marc means to me and what you mean to you
      aren't what I get when you tell me you're you, and aren't what you get
      when I tell you I'm Marc. We've shared our public keys -- our names, our
      appearances, our dialects, our intonations, whatever -- and included a
      payload -- "How are you today? &lt;request&gt;" "I'm fine &lt;response&gt;" -- and
      used our own private keys, our understandings of ourselves, to interpret
      it into a semantic, understandable message.</p>

      <p>You tell me you're fine, I'm reading it through my view of the world.
      Maybe I feel like shit and /I/ said I was fine, so now when you say
      you're fine I'm thinking maybe you feel like shit too. Or maybe I feel
      great and I don't question that you said you're fine.</p>

      <p>One of the things that allows public key cryptography to be reliable is
      that those big numbers don't change.</p>

      <p>And that's not the nature of people.</p>

      <p>Facebook and Twitter are really big things. We can include Google+ in
      this too, if you like -- interesting side note, BGP, which is
      essentially the protocol that makes the internet work, is a hell of a
      lot like Google+ -- but the idea is pretty much the same. These are
      places where you can communicate to a whole lot of people at once a
      specific thing that you want to share. A picture of your family
      vacation, your collection of plush animals stabbed with pens, a video of
      three pieces of bread falling off of a high shelf.</p>

      <p>You're selecting the content which is presented and it's being delivered
      to any number of people who can disregard it or interact with it at
      their leisure. If they don't care about it, they don't respond to it. If
      they do care, they respond. Positively or negatively.</p>

      <p>Negative responses, well, it's really easy to become hostile very
      quickly on the internet when you can't read a person's intent while
      they're writing this heartfelt explanation of how important badgers are
      to them and the fact that you've posted a picture of a stuffed animal in
      the form of a badger stabbed with a really nice hand-made pen (inlaid
      with blue stone) insults them terribly.</p>

      <p>Because if you could see my joking face you'd be like, "asshole," and
      punch me in the arm. But since it's the internet you flare up and tell
      me it's your right to stab animals as you see fit and you didn't hurt
      anyone in doing it and it's your property so you can do what you want,
      and why don't you fuck off you liberal moron.</p>

      <p>Whoa.</p>

      <p>That escalated quickly. I'd better rethink my plush-stabbing tendencies.
      Or maybe just defriend that person.</p>

      <p>Who then posts this gem: "SOME people are just so intolerant..." on
      their Facebook.</p>

      <p>I don't see it, because I defriended them because they're a jerk about
      my stabbing.</p>

      <p>The point is, and this is well-known by just about everyone, that social
      media -- or at least the emergent form of it -- isn't generally very
      social. It's either an echo chamber or a place for an argument or a
      muttered "meh" which flits off into the rest of your day like dust from
      your eyelash, never to be seen again. Until you need it. Until its
      semiotic meaning pays off.</p>

      <p>Until it's dirt.</p>

      <p>"Well, you posted in 1999 that you hated ligers, and I like ligers now
      and my friend is a zoologist who works with ligers."</p>

      <p>That time you got drunk with your best friend in the laundry room is
      going to be with you forever, but it's the semantic meaning that you're
      keeping, not the blatant fact of it. Not just the payload, but the
      entire cooperative system.</p>

      <p>When I dig up that post about ligers, all I'm doing is recalling the
      payload, and now I'm presenting it with my own semantic analysis which
      applies to right now.</p>

      <p>First impressions happen every day.</p>

      <p>I'm not going to go so far as to say that real life doesn't work like
      that: real life totally works like that and we're always gathering dirt
      on everyone we know because we know that someday it's going to pay off.
      But there's a difference between remembering that time when I loaned you
      ten bucks and seeing it posted on Facebook or Twitter. The difference is
      that I can't go back through a neatly-organized list of reasons to hate
      you, I have to filter it through my own memory and my own semantic
      interpretation first.</p>

      <p>I can't just call up a fact at whim and then generate a new,
      now-relevant semantic interpretation about it. I have to filter it
      first, through myself, instead of this reliable third-party who keeps
      everything and knows everything and to which everyone is held as
      standard.</p>

      <p>So now we'll talk about ephemeral communication.</p>

      <p>I'm paraphrasing a friend here: 1:1 choice-driven communication is a
      dead end for cooperation and growth.</p>

      <p>Early Friday morning, when it was really bad, I looked through my list
      of friends on Facebook, and in my phone, and on Google Hangouts, and so
      on. And I thought really hard about reaching out to any of them with all
      of my aggregated semantic knowledge about them stacking up and I reached
      a thing called analysis paralysis, or choice paralysis. It's also called
      overthinking, and it leads to things like not talking to anyone and
      laying in bed staring at your phone all night without actually doing
      anything, and wishing you could just fall asleep so then you won't have
      to live with this for a few hours.</p>

      <p>I guess you could call instant messaging or IRC ephemeral communication.
      Except you can click on the log button and save it all as much as you
      want. Every client makes this really easy. It's handy when you're
      working with people on something, or you want to remember that really
      cool link someone sent you about ligers, or when you really wanna dig up
      dirt to sock it to that asshole who told that jokey metaphor about
      Stephen the rat that offended your tender sensibilities.</p>

      <p>So no. They're not ephemeral communication at all.</p>

      <p>Snapchat is really popular right now. I didn't think much of it when it
      came out. My thought at the time was that we didn't need another instant
      messaging or video chat platform, and that it was stupid that it deletes
      it because why would you want to delete it, and you can use internet
      tricks to save it anyway (which people do, by the way, and they'll
      always do it so just accept it and move on) so why bother.</p>

      <p>But that isn't the real problem. It falls into the dilemma of 1:1
      choice-driven communication and perpetuates analysis paralysis and echo
      chambers.</p>

      <p>Which means it isn't anything new on the internet.</p>

      <p>You can save meatspace gifs. We do it a lot. I know this because I've
      seen it done and I've done it myself. Some people probably use this
      surreptitiously.</p>

      <p>I'm willing to bet the people who do so don't participate in the
      community.</p>

      <p>This is the difference between using a service which lets you "chat with
      your friends" and interacting with different people that you would never
      have interacted with before. Online dating is broken because you get to
      choose from a list of people who match your traits. That couple who've
      been married for twenty years who work in entirely different industries
      who accidentally bumped into each other at a bar in Reno -- dude, that's
      a movie plot. We no longer consider that sort of thing to be real.</p>

      <p>But it happens every day. It happens every day to you all the time.
      Every single moment you are glancing off of every other person around
      you in every way possible through your sensorium and all it takes is for
      both of you to be the right people and it to be the right moment. And a
      lot of the time that doesn't happen.</p>

      <p>I can guarantee you it's not likely to happen on Facebook or Snapchat or
      Twitter. Sure, it does sometimes -- one of the people in meatspace was
      someone I'd interacted with tangentially on Facebook whom I already knew
      I appreciated.</p>

      <p>And then you take a medium like meatspace.</p>

      <p>Let's talk about it.</p>

      <p>It's a website with a bunch of looping, short gifs of webcams on one
      side, and things that the people in the gifs probably wrote on the other
      side. There's scrollback, but pretty quickly the messages scroll off and
      you can't get back to them.</p>

      <p>You kinda have to be there to be there.</p>

      <p>When I tell you something I get to see your response to it. You lift a
      glass, you wave a hand. You smile. You make a disgusted face.</p>

      <p>So how is this different from video chat? Why is it different from
      chatroulette?</p>

      <p>Because you don't have to sit there watching me not do anything for the
      thirty seconds between the things we say. Because you don't have to
      listen to me sneezing.</p>

      <p>Because the only things we're offering to each other are tiny moments of
      half-intentional, half-accidental, ephemeral chemistry with little to no
      threat of retribution or lasting impact. Yeah, I'll carry that moment
      with me, but it's gonna be my semantic moment, not the one on
      Livejournal about ligers.</p>

      <p>Last night I made a bunch of new friends whom I'd get drunk with in the
      laundry room with no hesitation.</p>

      <p>This is what's missing from the internet and we need to explore it
      further. We need to find the meat in the metal. I've got some ideas.</p>

      <p>I'll bet you do too.</p>

      <p>Let's meatspace about them sometime.</p>
